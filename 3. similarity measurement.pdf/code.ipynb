Nilai positif menunjukkan bahwa objek-data ditempatkan dengan baik dalam cluster mereka, sedangkan nilai negatif menunjukkan bahwa objek-data mungkin ditempatkan dengan lebih baik dalam cluster lain. Dalam hal ini, metode Euclidean Distance memiliki Silhouette Score yang positif (0.0144), sedangkan metode Cosine Similarity memiliki Silhouette Score yang lebih rendah dan negatif (-0.0209).

    "Berdasarkan evaluasi DBI, metode Cosine Similarity lebih baik dalam hal kualitas clustering. Namun, berdasarkan evaluasi Silhouette Score, metode Euclidean Distance tampaknya lebih baik dalam menempatkan objek-data dalam cluster mereka. Oleh karena itu, kesimpulan dari penelitian ini dapat bervariasi tergantung pada metrik evaluasi yang lebih diutamakan. Dalam pengambilan keputusan akhir, penting untuk mempertimbangkan tujuan analisis clustering dan karakteristik data yang sedang diproses. Jika tujuan adalah untuk memaksimalkan kualitas clustering berdasarkan DBI, maka metode Cosine Similarity mungkin lebih disarankan. Namun, jika prioritas adalah memastikan objek-data ditempatkan dengan baik dalam cluster mereka, maka metode Euclidean Distance mungkin lebih sesuai. "
